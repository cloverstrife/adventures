                <h1>My First Trip to Russia</h1>
                <p>This was my first and worst trip abroad. It seemed like everything went wrong. Mostly
                    I just had bad luck but I could have avoided a lot of things if I had known more then.
                    Perhaps traveling to Russia first was a bad idea but bad ideas are usually fun.
                    Even though it was not a great trip it has given me my best travel story. 
                    It doesn't matter how many marathons I have ran overseas or all the majestic  mountains 
                    I've seen. THE story everyone always wants me to tell is about what happened inside 
                    that Russian hotel on my first trip.

                    <br><br>
                    I planned out my trip months in advance. I first got a passport then booked a flight
                    and hotel through Orbitz. Then I went through itseasy.com for a visa cause as an American
                    citizen you need a tourist visa to visit (unless you stop there on a cruise ship). I 
                    notified my bank that I was traveling to Russia so they would not freeze my account
                    for suspicious activity. However apparently you need to contact the credit card department 
                    and the debit card department if you plan to use both (I only contacted the credit card 
                    department). I also contacted my phone provider to hook me up with a travel package so I 
                    would have phone service at a reasonable price.
