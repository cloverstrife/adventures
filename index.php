    <h1>A little about me.</h1>
    <p>     I am Josh Albrecht and welcome to my site. I'm from the St. Louis area right smack
        dab in the middle of the USA. When I was a child in the 1980s I wanted to be an
        archeologist. That is until I found out what they really do. Like dig for artifacts
        with tiny shovels and brooms. What I really wanted to do is run from boulders, jump
        out of planes, fight Nazis and of course use a big bull whip. So I wanted to be
        Indiana Jones. I believe it was watching the Great Doctor Jones on the big screen
        that gave me my first taste of wanderlust.
        <br><br>
            Flash forward to 2014, I was in my early thirties and had never left the country.
        My greatest adventures involved me being drunk in public. I medicated my wanderlust
        with a constant flow of video games and movies. However killing Nazi Zombies on
        Call of Duty can ony suppress the desire for adventure not cure it. That all changed
        in March of 2014 when I finally got the balls to travel to Europe. Since then I have
        tried to leave the country at least once a year. This site is all about my adventures
        abroad.
